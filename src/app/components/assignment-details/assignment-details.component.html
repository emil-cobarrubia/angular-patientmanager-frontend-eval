        Please create a responsive web application that will have an upload view that accepts CSV files with
        patient records as input (see CSV sample file attached), and a view that displays the patients already
        uploaded to the application with basic ordering and filtering by patient name. Once uploaded, each
        patient record should be editable.
        The app must have the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="assignmentBullets">
        <li>Backend Web API written in .NET 6 C#.</li>
        <li>Frontend written in Angular 12 or higher.</li>
        <li>Data uploaded can be stored in SQL and should not be volatile (survive a restart).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="assignmentCloseout">
        Your app will be graded on best practices in coding, testing, validation techniques, architecture, UX and
        UI.

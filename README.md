# AngularPatientmanagerFrontendEval

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Disclaimer
This application is intended to be for evaluation and educational purposes only. This should not be used for processing or holding real data.

## Ensure the ASP.NET Web APIs are running
After successfully walking through the README in `PatientManager-API-BackEnd-Eval` repository [here](https://github.com/emilcobarrubia/PatientManager-API-BackEnd-Eval), you can proceed below.  
If the back-end is not up, no data will be displayed in the application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
